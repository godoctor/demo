# Demo: Customizing the Go Doctor

The sources in this repository illustrate how to build a custom Go Doctor tool with an additional, custom refactoring.  The demo refactoring adds "err error" to a function's return tuple and updates its `return` statements.

See http://gorefactor.org for general information about the Go Doctor, including an online demonstration.
